<h1>DEPRECATED</h1>
As I don't attend SeAMK anymore, I can't guarantee it is still working. It was still fun working on it during my Erasmus program in Finland :)

<h2>SeAMKTimeTableReader</h2>
Simple script to filter SeAMK, university in Sein√§joki, Finland, time tables with only courses you have.

This script allows you to filter SeAMK time tables and create a simple pdf file with your courses ordered by day.

In order to use this script, you must have at least <b>Java Runtime Environment 1.5</b> installed on your computer.<br/>
The script can be direclty downloaded from this repository's target directory on GitHub.

In order to this script to work,make sure there is a plain text file called <code><b>not_my_courses.txt</b></code> containing <b>ALL THE COURSES YOU DON'T HAVE</b> (one course per line) in the same directory as the jar file.<br/>
To run it, just double click on it. One pdf file per time table is created in the same directory.<br/>

You can also run form the terminal with : <br/><code>java -jar "SeAMK Timetable Reader.jar"</code>
